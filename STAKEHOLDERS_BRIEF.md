# Warehouse Management App — Stakeholder Brief

## 1) Executive Summary
A modern, minimalist warehouse management web app that centralizes goods and storage information, and enables secure, read-only shareable views for vendors, stakeholders, and partners. It reduces manual coordination, increases inventory accuracy, and speeds up decision-making through real‑time visibility and clean UX with subtle motion.

## 2) Core Value Proposition
- Single source of truth for SKUs, stock levels, and storage locations
- Operational efficiency via fast item updates and streamlined workflows
- Trusted data sharing with granular, read‑only views for external parties
- Lower coordination costs (fewer emails, spreadsheets, calls)
- Better planning through live status and lightweight analytics

## 3) Who This Is For (Stakeholders) and How It Creates Value
- **Warehouse Operators**
  - Faster add/update of items and bin usage; fewer picking/putaway errors
  - Clear, consistent location mapping for rapid floor execution
- **Inventory/Operations Managers**
  - Near real‑time stock status and bin utilization to prevent stockouts and congestion
  - Activity oversight; supports cycle counts and reconciliation
- **Procurement/Buying**
  - Visibility into current and inbound inventory to time POs and reduce carrying costs
  - Share curated SKU lists with vendors to align replenishment
- **Vendors/Suppliers**
  - Read‑only shared views of their SKUs, on‑hand, and movement expectations
  - Fewer back‑and‑forth communications, faster response times
- **Logistics/3PL Partners**
  - Access to fulfillment‑relevant data (e.g., pick volumes, shipping queues)
  - Improves SLA adherence and slotting efficiency
- **Finance/Accounting**
  - More accurate valuation snapshots; easier month‑end reconciliation
  - Supports shrinkage detection and audit trails (future)
- **Executives/Leadership**
  - High‑level KPIs on inventory turns, fill rate, and service levels
  - Confidence in data when reporting to the board and partners
- **IT/Security**
  - Clear access control (operator vs. shared public links), JWT‑based auth (planned)
  - Minimal footprint; API‑first and segmentable deployment

## 4) What It Does (Current Scope)
- Goods (SKUs) management: create/update entries with stock and location
- Storage bins: track basic capacity/usage
- Shareable read‑only views: generate links for vendors/stakeholders to see curated data
- Clean, fast UI with modern industrial palette and subtle animations

## 5) Near‑Term Roadmap
- CRUD completion: edit/delete for goods and bins; bulk import
- Public share pages with fine‑grained filters (SKU ranges, tags, stock fields)
- Authentication and roles: operator vs. viewer; JWT with role-based guardrails
- Audit logs: who changed what and when; exportable reports
- Advanced inventory ops: cycle counts, reorder points, putaway and pick path hints

## 6) KPIs and Success Metrics
- **Inventory accuracy**: shrinkage and variance delta vs. baseline
- **Cycle time**: time to add/update items and resolve discrepancies
- **Email/ticket volume**: decrease in vendor/partner data clarification requests
- **Vendor response time**: time from share creation to vendor acknowledgement
- **Fill rate / OTIF**: downstream indicators as data visibility improves

## 7) Security & Governance
- Read‑only share links for external audiences; no write permissions
- Planned JWT auth for operators; rate limiting and CORS hardening in production
- Principle of least privilege; audit trail and immutable logs (future)

## 8) Data Model (Initial)
- Goods: `{ id (SKU), name, stock, location }`
- Storage Bin: `{ id, capacity, used }`
- Share: `{ id, name, scope, url, access }` where `url` maps to a share route

## 9) Integration & Deployment
- API: Node/Express (`/api/*`), pluggable DB (Mongo planned)
- Frontend: React with Tailwind + Framer Motion, proxying API in dev
- Deployment targets: any Node‑compatible host, CDN for static assets

## 10) Risks & Mitigations
- Data quality: enforce validation and bulk import checks; add audit history
- Access leakage: scope‑limited, read‑only shares; tokenized links with expiry (future)
- Adoption: simple UX, minimal fields required, quick wins (fewer emails, faster answers)

## 11) Demo Paths
- Operator adds a SKU; stock instantly visible on dashboard and lists
- Manager creates a vendor share for specific SKUs; vendor uses link to check stock

## 12) Ask
- Align on MVP scope: CRUD completeness, share filters, and auth priority
- Identify first vendor/partner to pilot the share feature
- Approve KPI baseline and review cadence (bi‑weekly)
